the point of verification is to have a page with our rules, our code of conduct, privacy policy and other links a cloudflare turnstile human verification button.

Post cloudflare reporting a pass they need to authorize their account and then a url composed of the url (each server will have a url that is structured like "https://discordverify.awfixer.com/[guilid]/[userid]?direct=[true/false]" which will be generated by the button/interaction event in the discord server and the response token will be forwarded to the bot's backend to 'verify' the user, add the user to the main guild, and then give them the verified role in both the referring guild and the main guild.

if direct is not true, or the direct parameter is missing the verify page needs to report a failure and send the user to the home site (https://awfixer.com)
