you need to create setups and configurations for posgtres (via supabase), mongodb (via mongodb atlas), valkey (redis style caching), influxdb (for our server stats service/plugin), r2 (for all images and static assets) and hyperdrive (for http endpoint based storage needs, which is also hosted on cloudflare)

all emojis will be hosted via discord, so you need to add that to the configuration

## Influx Info
./influx.md

## MongoDB info
./mongo.md 

## Postgres Info
./postgres.md

## R2 info
./r2.md

## Valkey info
./valkey.md
